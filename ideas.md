Another important part of algorithm development is to develop thinking skills. By now, we developed one variation of the defective coin problem. The key point in solving such a problem is thinking through and solving the smaller sub problems and later aiming to solve the bigger problem. Think and come up with an idea to propose a different algorithm where such a computation (that is, to find an element that is different from the a set of elements that are similar except one) is useful. The new idea should enrich and enhance what had been developed already. Include a summary of one or more ideas in the space provided below.
